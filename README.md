## Cancer Detective Web App                    
Cancer Detective is a Streamlit web application designed to assist users in detecting different types of cancer through image analysis. The app leverages machine learning models trained on various datasets for skin, lung, and leukemia cancers, providing users with a user-friendly interface to upload images and receive diagnostic insights.

### Purpose
I created this web app for my Final Year project Proof of Concept (PoC). It aims to demonstrate the potential of machine learning in medical diagnostics and improve awareness and early cancer detection.

## Features

- **Multi-Cancer Detection:** It supports the detection of skin cancer (melanoma), lung cancer, and leukemia from uploaded images.
- **User Authentication:** Allows registration and login for both users and medical professionals.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Provides detailed performance metrics and insights through interactive plots and matrices.
- **Health Recommendations:** Displays personalized health messages based on detection results.
- **Real-Time Model Training:** Enables users to fine-tune the model based on their inputs.

### Home
On the Home page, users get an overview of what the web app offers. The application is designed to help detect various cancers by analyzing medical images. With this app, users can:
- Upload images for analysis of skin, lung, and leukemia cancers. ðŸ“¸                  
- Visualize detailed metrics about the modelâ€™s performance. ðŸ“Š                                        
- Train and customize the cancer detection models according to their needs. ðŸ§ 

### Detection
The Detection page allows users to detect different types of cancer and receive immediate feedback:
- **Upload Images**: Users can upload medical images from their device for analysis. ðŸ“¤
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users receive immediate feedback on whether the uploaded image is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). ðŸ’¡             

### Visualizing
The Visualizing page provides various metrics and visual aids to understand the model's performance:
- **Test Accuracy**: Displays the final accuracy on the test dataset. ðŸŽ¯
- **Training and Validation Accuracy**: Shows the model's performance improvement with each epoch. ðŸ“ˆ
- **Loss Metrics**: Tracks the reduction in loss throughout the training process. ðŸ“‰
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides a visual representation of the modelâ€™s classification results. ðŸ§©
